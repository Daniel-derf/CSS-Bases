            NASA’s Curiosity Mars Rover Reroutes Away From ‘Gator-Back’ Rocks
        </h2>

        <p>
            NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover spent most of March climbing the 
            “Greenheugh Pediment” – a gentle slope capped by rubbly 
            sandstone. The rover briefly summited this feature’s north 
            face two years ago; now on the pediment’s southern side, 
            Curiosity has navigated back onto the pediment to explore 
            it more fully.

            But on March 18, the mission team saw an unexpected terrain 
            change ahead and realized they would have to turn around: 
            The path before Curiosity was carpeted with more 
            wind-sharpened rocks, or ventifacts, than they have ever 
            seen in the rover’s nearly 10 years on the Red Planet.

            Ventifacts chewed up Curiosity’s wheels earlier in the 
            mission. Since then, rover engineers have found ways to 
            slow wheel wear, including a traction control algorithm, 
            to reduce how frequently they need to assess the wheels. 
            And they also plan rover routes that avoid driving over 
            such rocks, including these latest ventifacts, which are 
            made of sandstone – the hardest type of rock Curiosity has 
            encountered on Mars.
